h1. Introduction

Working with value object is a great help in daily work of software developer. There are several
advantages from which you will benefit:

* Clearer interfaces, you could see the business objects in the signature.
* Easier refactoring, the type information makes refactoring more secure.
* Higher quality, the possibility of accidental change of types are eliminated.
* Easier maintenance, the technical type is already provided by design.

This library should reduce the technical afford to introduce or start with value objects
by providing reusable wrapper types. The wrapper is not very complicated and everyone
could write his own set, but I donâ€™t want to do that every time for a new project. So I
decided to write this library.
